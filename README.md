Image Classification project on classifying Cats vs. Dogs building a CNN model
 ## **Dog vs. Cat Image Classification Using CNN**  

- **Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** to classify images of cats and dogs with an **accuracy of 85.02%**.  
- **Preprocessed 25,000+ images**, organized dataset structure, and implemented **data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator** to improve generalization.  
- **Designed and trained a deep learning model** with multiple **convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers** for binary classification.  
- **Implemented Predictive & Preventive Maintenance strategies** to improve model robustness and efficiency.  
- **Evaluated model performance using key metrics:**  
  - **Sensitivity (Recall):** 86.09%  
  - **Specificity:** 84.05%  
  - **F1-score:** 84.55%  
- **Automated test image classification** and generated a **predictions CSV** including:  
  - **Image names, probability scores, and predicted classes** for **5000 test images**.  
- **Applied data visualization, and model evaluation techniques** to refine classification accuracy and reduce false predictions.
